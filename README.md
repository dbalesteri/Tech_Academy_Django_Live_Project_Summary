# Tech_Academy_Live_Project_Summary

Over the past two weeks, as part of the Software Development Bootcamp  with The Tech Academy, I was tasked to be part of a team creating our own site application that was part of a larger overarching project.

This Live Project involved utilizing Microsoft Azure for project management, Git as the VCS, PyCharm as the IDE, and the Django framework.

All students were assigned user stories to complete in the two week sprint, adding increasingly more functionality and design to their section for users to interact with database information.

I chose to make my section a pet rescue adoption site.
